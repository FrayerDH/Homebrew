If there are enemies or breakable objects in the cone, make an attack against the next closest target in the cone. Un-upgraded, the projectile bounces only 1 time."

Each disc is lined with an anti-armor, energy-cutter edge and has a motor that keeps it spinning at nearly 60krpm for seconds after firing. The discs tend to bounce and hit more than the initial target, leaving customers with safety concerns that caused the end of this weapon's production."
